I am an experienced building designer looking to make the career shift to web development. 
From a young age I have enjoyed working with technology and solving problems. 
I built my first computer with my Uncle's help when I was 8.
It was around this time my teachers discovered that I had poor manual dexterity and that typing my school work would be how they accommodate my learning needs. 
This lent me to being familiar with using a computer from a very young age.
In highschool I used technology to augment live theatre performances. 
This inspired me me to study computer information systems after highschool. 
However due to event's in my personal life I would have to table my passion and take up a trade. 
I spent the next 5 years studying then working as a building designer in a small company. 
In this position I automated the repetitive parts of my job and took on some system administrative duties. 
During COVID my team had to transition from the office to WFH. 
During this time I setup the IT infrastructure and documentation to make this a reality. 
I have spent the last 6 months focused on developing my skills to become a web developer.
